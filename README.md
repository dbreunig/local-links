# Local Links

I've ran through too many tools for saving links. Some I still use (read-it-later apps like [Instapaper][instapaper] and [Readwise][readwise] are great!), but many I've abandoned. They tend to grow complex, in a direction that doesn't suit me, increase their costs, or embarass themselves on social media.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add StepList footer
- [ ] Clean up design
- [ ] Export a CSV or formatted Markdown of links based on the filter
